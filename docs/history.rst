SmartyPants
===========

**Perl SmartyPants or original SmartyPants.**

In 2002, `John Gruber`_  started the SmartyPants for `Movable Type`_, written
in Perl.

`Rael Dornfest`_ ported SmartyPants to Blosxom. Portions of the SmartyPants are
based on `Brad Choate`_'s nifty MTRegex plug-in. `Jeremy Hedley`_ and
`Charles Wiltgen`_ deserve mention for exemplary beta testing of SmartyPants.

Brad Choate also contributed a few bits of source code to the Python port.
Brad Choate is a fine hacker indeed. It was later packaged for PyPI by
Hao Lian.


smartypants
===========

**smartypants, Python [fork of] SmartyPants.**

In August 2013, smartypants became managed by `Yu-Jie Lin`_ after they
contacted Chad Miller and Hao Lian. Lin took over the project manager role and
the package ownership on PyPI. `Leo Hemsted`_ managed the project in 2017.

Since 2025, smartypants has been managed by `Justin Mayer`_.
