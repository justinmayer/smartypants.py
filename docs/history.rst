SmartyPants
===========

**Perl SmartyPants or original SmartyPants.**

In 2002, `John Gruber`_  started the SmartyPants for `Movable Type`_, written
in Perl.

`Rael Dornfest`_ ported SmartyPants to Blosxom. Portions of the SmartyPants are
based on `Brad Choate`_'s nifty MTRegex plug-in. `Jeremy Hedley`_ and
`Charles Wiltgen`_ deserve mention for exemplary beta testing of SmartyPants.

smartypants.py
==============

**smartypants.py, Python [port of] SmartyPants.**

In 2004, `Chad Miller`_ ported it to Python to use with Pyblosxom_.

.. _Pyblosxom: http://pyblosxom.github.io/

Brad Choate also contributed a few bits of source code to the Python port.
Brad Choate is a fine hacker indeed. It was later packaged for PyPI by
Hao Lian.


smartypants
===========

**smartypants, Python [fork of] SmartyPants.**

Since August 2013, smartypants has been managed by `Yu-Jie Lin`_ after
contacted Chad Miller and Hao Lian. Lin took over the project manager role and
the package ownership on PyPI. It has since then also officially supported
Python 3.

At this point, smartpants is heading towards as a *fork* of SmartyPants. The
".py" part is dropped from the project name, ".py" or "port" sometimes is still
used. For instance, to avoid confused with SmartyPants.

Nevertheless, the project name is *smartypants*.
